# **Hermetic**

**A Blockchain-Powered Real-Time Public Opinion App**

## **Overview**

Hermetic is an open-source, blockchain-based app designed to gauge real-time public opinion on policies, candidates, and government actions at all levels (presidential, congressional, and local). The app provides a secure, transparent platform where users can express their stance on political and social issues, creating a temperature gauge of U.S. public opinion. Hermetic integrates AI to simplify complex bills and policies, enhancing public understanding and engagement while promoting government accountability.

## **Purpose**

Hermetic empowers citizens to keep a watchful eye on governance, enabling a level of transparency and accountability that encourages informed participation. By breaking down policies and government actions into digestible insights, Hermetic makes it easier for users to understand and react to major issues.

Even if Hermetic isn’t officially adopted for voting, it functions as a powerful tool for civic engagement, providing insights that can influence public discourse and governmental decisions.
